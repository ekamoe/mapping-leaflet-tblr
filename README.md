# Mapping The Bare Life Review

## About

The [Bare Life Review](www.barelifereview.org) is a literary journal whose sole mission is to publish immigrant and refugee writers. We accept work from:

- Foreign-born writers living in the United States
- Writers living abroad who currently hold refugee and/or asylum-seeker status

To further showcase the diversity of the literature we publish, this webpage includes a map displaying the homelands of contributors to The Bare Life Review. The map has been built using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/).
