[The Bare Life Review](https://barelifereview.org) is a literary journal whose sole mission is to publish immigrant and refugee writers. We accept work from:

- Foreign-born writers living in the United States
- Writers living abroad who currently hold refugee and/or asylum-seeker status

This site includes a map displaying the birthplaces of contributors to inaugural issue of *The Bare Life Review*. The map has been built using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/).
